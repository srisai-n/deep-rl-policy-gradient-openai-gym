# deep-rl-policy-gradient-openai-gym
Deep Reinforcement Learning and Policy Gradient methods for solving OpenAI Gym Environments

**Summary**
- implemented the following four reinforcement learning models to successfully navigate the OpenAI Gym environments: CartPole and Atari BreakOut
1. Deep Q-Network (DQN)
2. Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN)
3. REINFORCE (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient)
4. Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)
- used Python, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, NumPy
- part of the course 'CSE 510 - Introduction to Reinforcement Learning' at University at Buffalo, SUNY
